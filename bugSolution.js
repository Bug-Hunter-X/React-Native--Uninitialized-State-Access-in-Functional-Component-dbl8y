The solution is to ensure that the state variable is initialized before accessing it.  This can be achieved by carefully managing the execution of your code, often by adding the state variable as a dependency to useEffect to ensure the effect only runs after it's initialized. 

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(count); // Now logs the correct value
  }, [count]); // Added count to the dependency array

  return (
    <div>Count: {count}</div>
  );
}
```
Another strategy is to provide a default value within the component's body while waiting for the state to be initialized, using conditional rendering or optional chaining:

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>Count: {count !== undefined ? count : 'Loading...'}</div>
  );
}
```
