This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This is often seen in functional components when using the `useState` hook.  If you access the state before the component has fully mounted, it will be undefined, leading to errors. For example, if you have a state variable `count` and try to log `count` within a useEffect hook without specifying a dependency array, it might log 'undefined' before the state is initialized. 

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(count); // Might log undefined initially
  });

  return (
    <div>Count: {count}</div>
  );
}
```
